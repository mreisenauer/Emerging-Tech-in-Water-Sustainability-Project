Meghan Reisenauer empirical coding project for application - The Institute for Policy Integrity, Research Associate

This coding project comes from an academic project for a class titled "Emerging Technologies in Water Sustainability," taken as part of my Master of Science, Environmental Engineering program at UC Berkeley.

Project Report Abstract

Solar-powered evaporation has become an increasingly popular and sustainable method for water desalination and purification. This study aimed to determine the evaporative performance of a 3D Graphene-Oxide cylindrical stalk with different calcium chloride salt concentrations. The motivation behind this study was the development of alternative desalination methods with reduced energy consumption requirements and increased resource capture. The method followed the procedures outlined in the Finnerty et al. 2021 paper. The key findings of this study revealed that the bulk evaporation rates of the 3D Graphene-Oxide cylindrical stalks were significantly higher than the controls, which did not have the 3D stalk. However, the increased salinity did not affect the evaporation rate, and the control solutions had similar evaporation rates amongst each other. These findings highlight the potential of using 3D Graphene-Oxide cylindrical stalks as an efficient and sustainable method for water desalination and purification.
